# IRC-Client-V3
This is an IRC client that I am making using the C++ standard libraries for networking and IO processing and ncurses for the terminal based interface. It is currently a work in progress.

## To Run
1. Clone directory
2. CD into directory
3. Run ```make```
4. If an error is thrown when linking create a directory called ```bin``` in the project root directory and then run ```make``` again

## To Contribute
If you wish to contribute please fork the repository and then create a branch for each feature you wish to add and when you feature is complete create a pull request to origin/master. The pull request will then be reviewed and merged if acceptable :)
